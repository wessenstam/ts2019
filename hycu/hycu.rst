Overview
++++++++

HYCU is the only solution built from the ground up to deliver a full suite of backup capabilities for Nutanix AHV and ESXi clusters, eliminating a key barrier to entry for AHV prospects. HYCU can be used to backup Nutanix Volumes VGs and Nutanix Files deployments.

Additionally, as pure software, HYCU can help grow Nutanix deals as additional nodes are positioned to act as a backup target for workloads.

**In this lab you will deploy and configure a HYCU appliance and explore different workflows for backup and recovery of data within a Nutanix environment.**

   .. note::

     It is important that the **Secondary** network be selected. In order to complete the :ref:`hycu-files` exercise, HYCU requires access to the Files client network.

#. Select the *Initials*\ **-HYCU** VM and click **Power on**.

   The CPU and memory resources of the backup appliance can be scaled up depending on the number of VM backups managed by HYCU. Complete sizing details are provided in the `HYCU User Guide <https://support.hycu.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001018365-Product-documentation>`_.

   The secondary disk added to the appliance is used as a data disk for the local HYCU database as well as maintenance operations. It is not used for storing VM backup data.

#. Once the VM has started, note the IP Address assigned by IPAM DHCP and click **Launch Console**.

#. Fill out the following fields, highlight **OK** and press **Return**:

   - **Hostname** - *Initials*\ **-HYCU**
   - **IPv4 address** - *IP Assigned by DHCP*
   - **Subnet mask** - 255.255.255.128
   - **Default gateway** - *Secondary VLAN Gateway* (e.g. 10.XX.YY.129)
   - **DNS server** - *Your DC VM IP*
   - **Search domain** - ntnxlab.local

   .. note:: Switch fields by pressing the Tab key.

   .. figure:: images/1.png

   Wait approximately 1 minute for the internal database to initialize and backup controller services to start.

#. Note the default credentials and press **Return**. Close the **HYCU** VM console.

   .. figure:: images/2.png

Adding A Backup Source
++++++++++++++++++++++

HYCU provides tight integration with Nutanix clusters running either AHV or ESXi. Rather than relying on traditional hypervisor "stun" snapshots, HYCU speaks directly to the Nutanix Distributed Storage Fabric to determine changed blocks via API and leverage efficient `redirect-on-write snapshots <https://nutanixbible.com/#anchor-book-of-acropolis-snapshots-and-clones>`_.

HYCU has also introduced support for non-Nutanix ESXi environments, allowing customers migrating to Nutanix from legacy platforms a single backup solution.

#. Open \https://<*HYCU-VM-IP*>:8443/ in a browser. Log in to the **HYCU** HTML5 web interface using the default credentials:

   - **Username** - admin
   - **Password** - admin

#. From the toolbar, click :fa:`cog` **> Sources**.

   .. figure:: images/3.png

#. Click **+ New** and fill out the following fields:

   - **URL** - *Your Prism Element URL* (e.g. https://10.XX.YY.37:9440)
   - **User** - admin
   - **Password** - techX2019!

#. Click **Save**.

#. After the job has been initiated, click **Close**.

   All jobs are launched asynchronously and can be tracked on the **Jobs** page.

   .. figure:: images/4.png

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Virtual Machines** and validate that your cluster's VMs are listed in the table.

Adding A Backup Target
++++++++++++++++++++++

The target is used for storing backups coordinated by HYCU. HYCU supports AWS, S3 (including Nutanix Buckets), Azure, NFS (including Nutanix Files), SMB (including Nutanix Files), and iSCSI storage targets (including Nutanix Volumes).

In this exercise you will create a Nutanix Volume group to use as a target for VM backup data. In a production environment the HYCU appliance and target storage would not reside on the same cluster as the source VMs.

#. From the HYCU toolbar, click :fa:`cog` **> iSCSI Initiator**.

#. Highlight the **Initiator Name** and copy to your clipboard or an external text file. Click **Close**.

   .. figure:: images/6.png

#. From **Prism > Storage > Table > Storage Container**, select **+ Storage Container**.

#. Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

   - **Name** - *Initials*\ -Backup
   - Select **Advanced Settings**
   - Select **Compression**
   - **Delay (In Minutes)** - 60
   - Select **Erasure Coding**

   .. figure:: images/5.png

   Erasure Coding is well suited to backup target use cases as retained snapshots will become write cold and not frequently overwritten.

#. From **Prism > Storage > Table > Volume Groups**, select **+ Volume Group**.

#. Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

   - **Name** - *Initials*\ -HYCU-Target
   - **iSCSI Target Name Prefix** - *Initials*\ -HYCU-Target
   - **Description** - HYCU Target VG
   - Select **+ Add New Disk**

     - **Storage Container** - *Initials*\ -Backup
     - **Size (GiB)** - 1000
   - Select **Enable external client access**
   - Select **CHAP Authentication**
   - **Target Password** - nutanixnutanix
   - Select **+ Add New Client**

     - **Client IQN** - *HYCU iSCSI Initiator IQN*
     - Select **Add**

   .. figure:: images/7.png

   HYCU's current recommendation is to use 1 disk per Volume Group.

#. Select *Initials*\ **-HYCU-Target** VG and note the **Target IQN Prefix** in the **Volume Group Details** table. Triple-click this value to fully select it. Copy the value to your clipboard.

   .. figure:: images/8.png

#. From **Prism >** :fa:`cog` **> Cluster Details**, note the **iSCSI Data Services IP**. Click **Cancel**.

   .. figure:: images/9.png

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Targets**.

#. Click **+ New**, fill out the following fields, and click **Save**:

   - **Name** - NutanixVG
   - **Concurrent Backups** - 4
   - **Description** - *Nutanix Cluster Name* HYCU-Target VG
   - **Type** - iSCSI
   - **Target Portal** - *Nutanix cluster iSCSI Data Services IP*
   - **Target Name** - *Initials*\ -HYCU-Target IQN
   - Select **CHAP**
   - **Target Secret** - nutanixnutanix

   .. figure:: images/10.png

   Maximum concurrent backups is the number of backup or restore jobs that will run in parallel, and is a factor of how much disk throughput the backup target is capable of providing. A default of 4 can be safely configured for a single vDisk VG target.

   Multiple backup targets can be added to support backup jobs.

Configuring Backup Policies
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

HYCU uses policies to define RPO, RTO, retention, and backup target(s), allowing for the easy application of these SLAs to groups of VMs.

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Policies**.

   By default HYCU is configured with 4 different Policies:

   - **Gold** - 4 Hour RPO, 4 Hour RTO
   - **Silver** - 12 Hour RPO, 12 Hour RTO
   - **Bronze** - 24 Hour RPO, 24 Hour RTO
   - Exclude - Backup not required

#. To create a custom policy, click **+ New**.

#. Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

   - **Name** - Fast
   - **Description** - 1 Hour RPO/RTO, Fast Restore Enabled (1 Day)
   - **Enabled Options** - Backup, Fast Restore
   - **Backup Every** - 1 Hours
   - **Recover Within** - 1 Hours
   - **Retention** - 4 Weeks
   - **Targets** - Automatically selected
   - **Backup Threshold** - 25%
   - **Fast Restore Retention** - 1 Day

   .. figure:: images/11.png

   HYCU supports multiple advanced configurations for backup policies, including:

   - **Backup Windows** - Allows an administrator to define granular time of day and day of week schedules to enforce backup policy.
   - **Copy** - Asyncronously copies data from the primary backup target to a configurable secondary backup target during periods of non-peak utilization.
   - **Archiving** - Allows an administrator to target slower, cold storage for long term retention of **full** backups.
   - **Fast Restore** - Retains and restores from local snapshots on the Nutanix cluster for rapid restore operations.
   - **Backup from Replica** - For VMs that use native Nutanix replication from a primary cluster to a secondary cluster, this feature will backup VMs from the replicated snapshots on the secondary cluster. This functionality can significantly reduce data movement for scenarios such as Remote Office Branch Office. It also removes the need for deployment of agents/proxies within the remote site.

   HYCU is also unique in its ability for administrators to define desired RTO. By specifying a desired **Recover Within** period and selecting **Automatic** target selection, HYCU will compute the right target to send the VM. The performance of the target is constantly monitored to ensure it can recover the data within the configured window. If a HYCU instance has several targets configured, a subset can be selected and HYCU will still intelligently choose between the selected targets.

#. Select the **Exclude** policy and click **Set Default > Yes**.

   .. figure:: images/12.png

   This will set the default policy for VMs to not be backed up by HYCU. In a production environment you could choose the appropriate policy to minimally backup all VMs by default. Any new VMs created on the source cluster(s) will automatically be applied the default policy.

Backing Up A VM
+++++++++++++++

In this exercise you will back up a Windows Server VM with a mounted iSCSI Volume Group. In-guest iSCSI disks are common in enterprise apps such as SQL Server that require shared storage for high availability.

#. In **Prism > VM > Table**, click **+ Create VM**.

#. Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

   - **Name** - *Initials*\ -HYCUBackupTest
   - **vCPU(s)** - 2
   - **Number of Cores per vCPU** - 1
   - **Memory** - 4 GiB
   - Select **+ Add New Disk**

     - **Operation** - Clone from Image Service
     - **Image** - Windows2012
     - Select **Add**
   - Select **Add New NIC**

     - **VLAN Name** - Secondary
     - Select **Add**

#. Select the *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** VM and click **Power on**.

#. Once the VM has started, click **Launch Console**.

#. Complete the Sysprep process and provide a password for the local Administrator account (e.g. **nutanix/4u**).

#. Log in as the local Administrator and open **iSCSI Initiator**. When prompted to start the Microsoft iSCSI service, click **Yes**.

#. In **iSCSI Initiator Properties**, select the **Configuration** tab and note the **Initiator Name** value.

   .. figure:: images/14.png

   .. note::

     It is recommended to connect to the *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** via RDP so you can copy/paste the initiator name (IQN).

#. From **Prism > Storage > Table > Volume Groups**, select **+ Volume Group**.

#. Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

   - **Name** - *Initials*\ -BackupTestVG
   - **iSCSI Target Name Prefix** - *Initials*\ -HYCU-Target
   - **Description** - HYCU Target VG
   - Select **+ Add New Disk**

     - **Storage Container** - Default
     - **Size (GiB)** - 10
   - Select **Enable external client access**
   - Select **+ Add New Client**

     - **Client IQN** - *Initials*\ -HYCUBackupTest *Initiator Name*
     - Select **Add**

#. Return to your *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** console or RDP session.

#. In **iSCSI Initiator Properties**, select the **Targets** tab.

#. Provide your Nutanix cluster's **iSCSI Data Services IP** in the **Target** field and click **Quick Connect**.

#. Select the discovered *Initials*\ -BackupTestVG target and click **Done > OK**.

   .. note::

      If you are unable to discover or connect to the Volume Group you may need to disable the Windows Firewall.

   .. figure:: images/15.png

#. Open PowerShell and run the following command to enable and format the disk:

   .. code-block:: powershell

     Get-Disk -Number 1 | Initialize-Disk -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
     New-Partition -DiskNumber 1 -UseMaximumSize -AssignDriveLetter -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Format-Volume -Confirm:$false

#. Finally, create multiple files on the OS (C:) disk (e.g. text files on the Desktop), as well as the iSCSI (E:) disk.

   .. figure:: images/13.png

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Virtual Machines**.

   Before assigning a policy to our VM, you will create a stored credential that HYCU can use to authenticate against the guest, allowing it to perform file and application aware backups, as well as discover your iSCSI disk.

#. From the upper toolbar, click **(Key Icon) Credentials > + New**.

#. Fill out the following fields and click **Save**:

   - **Name** - Local Windows Admin
   - **Username** - Administrator
   - **Password** - *The password you defined when creating the HYCUBackupTest VM*

#. Select the *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** VM and click **(Key Icon) Credentials**. Select the **Local Windows Admin** credential and click **Assign** to map the credential to the selected VM.

   .. note::

     HYCU will automatically synchronize at regular intervals. If *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** does not appear in the list of available Virtual Machines, click **Synchronize** to pull the updated list from Prism.

   HYCU will validate the credentials can be used to authenticate to the VM, after a moment the **Discovery** column should display a green check indicating discovery was successful.

   .. figure:: images/16.png

   .. note::

     HYCU also allows for Owners to be assigned to VMs or Shares being backed up. This assignment allows for the application of self-service policies, allowing Active Directory users or groups access to specific resources. Available roles for self-service include: Viewer (read-only), Administrator, Backup Operator, and Restore Operator.

     .. figure:: images/19.png

#. Select the *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** VM and click **(Shield Icon) Policies**.

#. Select your customized **Fast** policy and click **Assign**.

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Jobs** to monitor the backup progress.

   Note in the details of the backup job that not only did HYCU leverage Nutanix Change Block Tracking APIs to backup the OS disk, but also the volume group mounted via iSCSI. Additionally, when directly attaching a VG to a VM in AHV (without using the in-guest iSCSI initiator), HYCU can backup and restore VGs without the need for in-guest discovery credentials.

   .. figure:: images/17.png

#. Upon completion of the first full backup, select **Dashboard** from the sidebar and confirm all policies are compliant and 100% of VM's have been protected.

#. Return to **Virtual Machines** and select the *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** VM. Click **Backup** to manually trigger an incremental backup.

   .. figure:: images/18.png

Restoring Backups
+++++++++++++++++

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Virtual Machines >** *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest**.

#. In the **Details** table below, mouse over the **Compliancy** and **Backup Status** icons for additional information about each Restore Point, including size, time to perform backup, type of backup, etc.

   .. figure:: images/21.png

#. Select the most recent incremental restore point and click **Restore VM or vDisks**.

   HYCU offers the ability to overwrite or clone the entire VM, as well as the ability to selectively restore or clone individual VM disks or volume groups. Restoring volume groups is helpful in use cases where you would prefer to mount a disk to an existing VM.

   Additionally, both local disks and volume groups for a given restore point can be exported to an SMB share of NFS mount.

#. Select **Clone VM** and click **Next**.

   .. figure:: images/20.png

#. Fill out the following fields and click **Restore**:

   - **Select a Storage Container** - Original location
   - **New VM Name** - *Initials*\ -HYCUBackupTest-Clone
   - **Power Virtual Machine On** - Disabled
   - **Restore Instance** - Automatic

   .. note::

     If multiple Nutanix clusters were configured, you could target a separate cluster for restoring your VM.

     Selecting Automatic for Restore Instance will default to the fastest option. For this policy that would be the local Nutanix snapshot as opposed to the backup stored on the **NutanixVG** volume group. Manually selecting the instance is helpful when wanting to test RTO from backup or archive targets.

#. In **Prism > VM > Table**, power off your original *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** VM and **then** power on *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest-Clone**.

   .. note::

     Because the original virtual machine and the restored one have the same network and iSCSI configuration settings after the restore, make sure both the virtual machines are not turned on at the same time to avoid any potential issues.

#. Launch the VM console and verify all files and disks appear as expected within the VM. You can also verify that a clone of the Nutanix Volume has been created as well.

   *Congratulations! You've just restored your first VM and volume group using HYCU.*

#. In **Prism > VM > Table**, delete your *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest-Clone** VM and **then** power on your original *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** VM.

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Jobs** and note the time required to perform the VM restore.

   Because the backup policy was configured to retain local snapshots on the Nutanix cluster, the restore operation should be nearly instant.

Restoring VM Files
..................

In addition to restoring full VMs or disks, HYCU can also be used to directly restore files from a backed up VM or volume group. Often the need to restore VMs is for the sole purpose of obtaining an inadvertently deleted or corrupt file, the ability to restore files directly reduces the time and resources required to achieve the same end result.

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Virtual Machines >** *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest**.

#. Select the most recent incremental snapshot and click **Restore Files**.

   This will mount the backup and allow the user to browse the local filesystem.

#. Select one or more files you had previously created on the volume group (E:) and click **Next**.

   .. figure:: images/22.png

#. Select **Restore to Virtual Machine** and click **Next**. Alternatively, if you have completed the :ref:`files` lab, you can opt to restore the file directly to an SMB share.

#. Fill out the following fields and click **Restore**:

   - **Path** - Original location
   - **Mode** - Rename restored
   - Select **Restore ACL** (Default)

#. Launch a console for *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** and verify the file was restored.

   .. figure:: images/23.png

   HYCU provides flexibility for restoring Nutanix VMs, VGs, and file data while maintaining very simple "Prism-like" workflows. HYCU takes advantage of native Nutanix storage APIs to allow for fast and efficient backup and restore operations.

.. _hycu-files:

(Optional) Nutanix Files Integration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

HYCU is the first solution to provide fully integrated backup and restore capabilities for Nutanix Files using native Nutanix Change File Tracking (CFT) APIs.

While classic backup solutions heavily burden the file server by using the Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) approach, needing to traverse the whole file tree to identify changed files, HYCU uses Nutanix storage layer snapshots and CFT to get the changed files instantly. This means HYCU backups remove impact on the file server and significantly reduce the data-loss risk by backing up file share changes on hourly basis, compared to classic, nightly file share backups.

This exercise requires completion of the :ref:`files` lab to properly stage the environment. In this exercise you will configure Nutanix Files as a backup source, as well as target a Nutanix Files SMB share for backup data.

Adding SMB Share Target
.......................

For the purposes of this exercise, you will back up one Files share source to a Files share target. First you will define a share on your Files cluster that can be used as a target for backup data.

Files backups require either a NFS export, SMB share or S3 (Cloud) target, meaning Nutanix Buckets could also be used. iSCSI targets are currently unsupported as the files being backed up cannot be written directly to block storage.

#. In **Prism > File Server**, click **+ Share/Export**.

#. Fill out the following fields and click **Next > Next > Create**:

   - **Name** - *Initials*\ -HYCUTarget
   - **File Server** - *Initials*\ -Files
   - **Select Protocol** - SMB

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Targets**.

#. Click **+ New**, fill out the following fields, and click **Save**:

   - **Name** - Files-HYCUTarget
   - **Concurrent Backups** - 1
   - **Description** - *Nutanix Files Cluster Name* HYCUTarget Share
   - **Type** - SMB
   - **Domain** - NTNXLAB
   - **Username** - Administrator
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u
   - **SMB Server Name** - *Initials*\ -Files.ntnxlab.local
   - **Shared Folder** - /\ *Initials*\ -HYCUTarget

   .. figure:: images/24.png

Configuring API Access
......................

HYCU requires credentials that allow it to access Nutanix Files REST APIs, including CFT.

#. In **Prism > File Server**, select your *Initials*\ **-Files** server and click **Manage roles**.

   .. figure:: images/25.png

#. Under **REST API Access Users**, click **+ New user**.

#. Fill out the following fields and click **Save > Close**:

   - **Username** - hycu
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u

   .. figure:: images/26.png

Adding Nutanix Files Source
...........................

Protecting Files is similar to adding a hypervisor source to HYCU, with the exception that adding a Files source will provision an additional HYCU instance on the Nutanix cluster running Files. The purpose of this additional instance is to offload the file copy operations from the HYCU backup controller.

For AHV clusters with DHCP enabled, the additional HYCU instance can be provisioned automatically when adding the Files source. For ESXi or non-DHCP environments, the additional HYCU instance must be provisioned manually (similar to the original HYCU backup controller deployment). For complete details on manual deployment, see the `HYCU User Guide <https://support.hycu.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001018365-Product-documentation>`_.

#. From the **HYCU** toolbar, click :fa:`cog` **> Nutanix Files**.

#. Click **+ New** and fill out the following fields:

   - **URL** - https://\ *Initials*\ -files.ntnxlab.local:9440
   - **Nutanix Files Server Credentials > Username** - hycu
   - **Nutanix Files Server Credentials > Password** - nutanix/4u
   - **Backup Credentials > Username** - NTNXLAB\\Administrator
   - **Backup Credentials > Password** - nutanix/4u

   The **Nutanix Files Server Credentials** is the REST API credential configured in the previous exercise, HYCU uses the API to understand which files have been updated since the previous backup. The **Backup Credentials** are for HYCU to access the share and perform the file copies, this user should have read access to all shares being backed up by HYCU.

   .. figure:: images/27.png

   .. note::

     The need to access the shares to copy files is the reason HYCU was deployed on the **Secondary** network. During the :ref:`files` lab, the **Primary** network was chosen as the storage network, meaning other VMs on the **Primary** network would be unable to access the shares.

#. Click **Save** to add the Files source and begin provisioning the file copy HYCU instance.

   You can observe the creation of the *Initials*\ **-HYCU-1** VM in Prism and monitor the overall status on the HYCU **Jobs** page. This process should take approximately 3 minutes to complete.

   .. figure:: images/28.png

Backing Up & Restoring Files
............................

Backup and restore for Files operates very similarly to VM/VG workflows, using the same customizable policies and owner/self-service constructs.

#. Add the SMB target you created, **Files-HYCUTarget** into customized **Fast** policy.

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Shares**.

#. Select the **Marketing** share and click **(Shield Icon) Policies**.

   .. note::

     If you have created other shares that are populated with files you could select one of those as well.

#. Select your customized **Fast** policy and click **Assign**.

#. Return to **Jobs** to verify the initial backup completes successfully.

#. Using your Windows Tools VM or *Initials*\ **-HYCUBackupTest** VM, access your Marketing share (e.g. ``\\<Initials>-Files\Marketing``) and perform the following:

   - Update a file (e.g. edit a text file)
   - Add a new file
   - Delete an existing file

#. From the **HYCU** sidebar, click :fa:`bars` **> Shares**.

#. Select the **Marketing** share and click **Backup** to force an incremental backup.

   Depending on the size of the files added, the incremental backup should complete in under 1 minute.

#. Under **Restore Points** you can select the latest restore point and hover over **Backup Status** to determine both the number of files changed since the previous backup, as well as the incremental size of the backup.

   .. figure:: images/29.png

   Do these values accurately reflect the files added/changed to your Marketing share?

   Note that the target in the image above is **Files-HYCUTarget**. How was this determined without editing the backup policy?

#. Select the original, full backup restore point and click **Browse & Restore Files**.

   .. figure:: images/30.png

#. Select the file you had previously deleted from the Marketing share and click **Next**.

#. Target the original location and click **Restore**.

#. Return to your client VM console and refresh the Marketing share to view your previously deleted file.

   .. figure:: images/31.png

   Within a few clicks, administrators or end users can easily restore individual files, folders, or entire Nutanix Files shares using HYCU and CFT APIs.
