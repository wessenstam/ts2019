Nutanix Global Tech Summit
--------------------------

Welcome to Nutanix Global Tech Summit 2019!

Following the General Session on Tuesday morning, you will be able to access the **Hands on Learning** lab content.

Labs are designed to be completed by each individual, not in groups. Each Nutanix employee registered for the **Hands on Learning** track must complete the **Era** and **Flow** labs, as well as a minimum of 1 **Sponsored Lab**. You should be able to complete 2-4 additional labs by the end of the day Wednesday.

**For each lab you complete & validate, you'll be entered into a raffle to win a** `complete Raspberry Pi 3 kit <https://www.aboxtek.com/products/abox-raspberry-pi-3b-16gb>`_!
