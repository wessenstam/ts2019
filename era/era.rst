Overview
++++++++

Nutanix Era is a software suite that automates and simplifies database administration â€“ bringing One Click simplicity and invisible operations to database provisioning and lifecycle management (LCM).

With One Click database provisioning and Copy Data Management (CDM) as its first services, Nutanix Era enables DBAs to provision, clone, refresh, and backup their databases to any point in time. Line of business applications in every vertical depend on databases, providing use cases in both production and non-production environments.

**In this lab you will explore how Era can be used to standardize database deployment, allow for rapid cloning from a production database to a clone used for application development, updating that clone based on production data, and finally leveraging the REST API to understand how Era can integrate with a customer's existing automation tools.**

- PostgreSQL 9.x and 10.x
- SQL Server 2008 R2, SQL Server 2012, SQL Server 2014, and SQL Server 2016

Era can be used to provision database servers and databases on the registered Nutanix cluster, or you can register an existing source database running on the cluster. In this lab, you will provision a new PostgreSQL database server and database.

Era makes it even simpler to provision a simple PostgreSQL database by providing sample profiles for **Software**, **Compute**, and **Database Parameters**. You will explore each of these profiles to understand how they are configured.

#. Select the **Era > Getting Started** drop down menu and click **Profiles**.

   .. figure:: images/3g.png

#. Select **Software** and note there are included profiles for **PostgreSQL 10.4** and **MariaDB 10.3** shipped with Era.

   Additional PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, and Oracle profiles can be created by registering database server VMs with Era.

#. Select **Compute > DEFAULT_OOB_COMPUTE** and note the default Compute Profile creates a 4 core, 32GiB RAM VM to host the database. To reduce memory consumption in the shared lab environment, you will create a custom Compute Profile.

#. Click **+ Create** and fill out the following fields:

   - **Name** - Lab
   - **Description** - Lab Compute Profile
   - **vCPUs** - 1
   - **Cores per CPU** - 2

  Click **OK**.

  You can view the imported data by right-clicking **table1** and selecting **View/Edit Data > All Rows**.

Cloning Your PostgreSQL Source
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now that you have created a source database, you can easily clone it using Era Time Machine. Database clones are helpful for development and testing purposes, allowing non-production environments to utilize product data without impacting production operations. Era clones utilize Nutanix-native copy-on-write cloning technology, allowing for zero-byte database clones. This space efficiency can significantly lower storage costs for environments supporting large numbers of database clones.

#. In **Era > Time Machines**, select the Time Machine instance for your source database.

   .. figure:: images/16a2.png

#. Click **Snapshot** and enter **First** as the **Snapshot Name**.

   .. figure:: images/17a.png

#. Click **Create**.

   You can monitor the **Create Snapshot** job in **Era > Operations**.

   .. figure:: images/18a2.png

#. After the snapshot job completes, select the Time Machine instance for your source database in **Era > Time Machines** and click **Clone Database**.

#. On the **Time** tab, select **Snapshot > First**.

   .. note::

     Without creating manual snapshots, Era also offers the ability to clone a database based on **Point in Time** increments including Continuous (Every Second), Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly. Availability is controlled by the SLA of the source.

   .. figure:: images/19a2.png

#. Click **Next**.

#. On the **Database Server** tab, fill out the following fields:

   - **Database Server** - Create New Server
   - **VM Name** - *Initials*-DBServer-Clone
   - **Compute Profile** - Lab
   - **Network Profile** - DEFAULT_OOB_NETWORK
   - **SSH Public Key** -

   .. code-block:: text

     ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCoQRdEfm8ZJNGlYLQ2iw08eVk/Wyj0zl3M5KyqKmBTpUaS1uxj0K05HMHaUNP+AeJ63Qa2hI1RJHBJOnV7Dx28/yN7ymQpvO1jWejv/AT/yasC9ayiIT1rCrpHvEDXH9ee0NZ3Dtv91R+8kDEQaUfJLYa5X97+jPMVFC7fWK5PqZRzx+N0bh1izSf8PW0snk3t13DYovHFtlTpzVaYRec/XfgHF9j0032vQDK3svfQqCVzT02NXeEyksLbRfGJwl3UsA1ujQdPgalil0RyyWzCMIabVofz+Czq4zFDFjX+ZPQKZr94/h/6RMBRyWFY5CsUVvw8f+Rq6kW+VTYMvvkv

   .. figure:: images/20a2.png

#. Click **Next**.

#. On the **Database Server** tab, fill out the following fields:

   - **Name** - *Initials*\_LabDB_Clone
   - **Description** - (Optional) Description
   - **Password** - techX2019!
   - **Database Parameter Profile** - DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PARAMS

   .. figure:: images/21a2.png

#. Click **Clone**.

   The cloning process will take approximately the same amount of time as provisioning the original database and can be monitored in **Era > Operations**.

   While waiting for the clone to complete, explore **Era > SLAs** to understand the differences between standard SLAs offered by Era, or create your own custom SLA.

   .. figure:: images/21b.png

#. Following the completion of the clone operation, you can connect to the clone instance as described in the previous section, `Connecting to the Database`_.

   .. figure:: images/23a2.png

   The newly provisioned clone is now ready to be used.

Refreshing A Cloned Database
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ability to easily refresh a cloned database using new data from the source database improves development, test, and other use cases by ensuring they have access to new and relevant data. In this section you will add a new table for storing data to your source database, and refresh the existing clone.

#. In **pgAdmin**, select your source database (**NOT** the cloned database), and from the menu bar click **Tools > Query Tool**.

   .. figure:: images/25a2.png

#. From the **Query Tool**, type the following SQL command into the editor:

   .. code-block:: postgresql
     :name: products-table-sql

     CREATE TABLE products (
     product_no integer,
     name text,
     price numeric
     );

#. Click :fa:`bolt` **Execute/Refresh**.

   .. figure:: images/26a.png

#. Verify the creation of the table under **Schemas > Public > Tables > products**.

   .. note::

     You may need to refresh **Tables** for the newly created table to appear.

   .. figure:: images/27a2.png

   Previously you created a manual snapshot on which to base your cloned database, for the refresh you will leverage the **Point in Time** capability of Era.

   The default schedule for **Log Catch Up**, configured when provisioning the source database, is every 30 minutes. Based on this schedule, you should expect to be able to refresh the database based on updates older than 30 minutes with no further action required.

   In this case, you just created the **products** table in your source database, so a manual execution of **Log Catch Up** would be required to copy transactional logs to Era from your source database.

#. In **Era > Time Machines**, select the Time Machine instance for your source database and click **Log Catch Up > Yes**.

   .. figure:: images/27c.png

#. Once the **Log Catchup** job completes, in **Era > Databases > Clones**, select the clone of your source database and click **Refresh**.

   .. figure:: images/27b2.png

#. Refreshing to the latest available **Point in Time** is selected by default. Click **Refresh**.

   .. figure:: images/27d.png

#. Observe the steps taken by Era to refresh the cloned database in **Operations**.

   .. figure:: images/27e.png

#. Once the **Refresh Clone** job is complete, refresh the **Tables** view of your clone database in **pgAdmin** and confirm the **products** table is now present.

   .. figure:: images/28a2.png

   In just a couple of clicks and minutes you were able to update your cloned database using the latest available production data. This same approach could be leveraged to recover absent data from a database by provisioning a clone based on a previous snapshot or point in time.

#. Return to the **Dashboard** and review the critical information Era provides to administrators, including storage savings, clone aging, tasks, and alerts.

   .. figure:: images/28b2.png

Using the Era REST API Explorer
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Era features an "API first" architecture and provides a fully documented REST API to allow for automation and orchestration of its functions through external tools. Similar to Prism, Era also provides a Rest API Explorer to easily discover and test API functions.

#. From the menu bar, select **Admin > REST API Explorer** from the top right.

   .. figure:: images/29.png

#. Expand the different categories to view the available operations, including registering Nutanix clusters, registering and provisioning databases, cloning and refreshing databases, updating profiles and SLAs, and getting operation and alert information.

#. As a simple test, expand **Databases > GET /databases**.

   This function returns JSON containing details regarding all registered and provisioned databases and requires no additional parameters.

#. Click **Try it out > Execute**.

   .. figure:: images/30.png

   You should receive a JSON response body similar to the image below.

   .. figure:: images/32.png

   This API can be used to create powerful workflows using tools like Nutanix Calm, ServiceNow, Ansible, or others. As an example you could provision a Calm blueprint containing the web tier of an application and use a Calm eScript to invoke Era to clone an existing database and return the IP of the newly provisioned database to Calm.
